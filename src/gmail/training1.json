                "content": "View this post on the web at https://www.meidasplus.com/p/important-message-from-ben-meiselas-b8c\r\n\r\nBy Ben Meiselas\r\nHey MeidasMighty. It\u2019s Ben Meiselas, co-founder of MeidasTouch Network.\r\nYesterday was a big win for the pro-democracy community and a major loss for Trump, Musk, and DOGE. Here\u2019s what happened. \r\nThe pro-democracy candidate for the vacant Wisconsin Supreme Court seat, Judge Susan Crawford, defeated the MAGA/DOGE candidate Brad Schimel. Judge Crawford won 55.1% to 44.9%, and she flipped at least nine counties that voted for Trump in November.\r\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court will now be controlled by a pro-democracy majority.\r\nThe illegal gerrymandering tricks by the MAGA Republicans in Wisconsin will now likely be over.\r\nThis will likely lead to Democrats picking up more House of Representatives seats in 2026 in Wisconsin and help Democrats flip the House blue and reclaim the majority. In addition, essential rights and freedoms in Wisconsin will now be protected, like reproductive rights.\r\nThe election results in Wisconsin were a validation of the growing and gathering strength of the pro-democracy movement in the United States. It was also a major repudiation of Musk and Trump and DOGE.\r\nElon Musk put $20 million into the race, made a personal visit to hold a rally in Green Bay this past weekend, and was literally handing out money to people to vote for Schimel. Musk handed out $1 million checks to some people who participated in his pay-for-play vote stunt.\r\nIn addition to Musk, Trump repeatedly directed people to vote for Schimel in social media posts and from the Oval Office. Trump had the entire force of the federal government and the White House to try and help Schimel win. He failed big time.\r\nFurther, all of the right-wing \u201cpodcast bros\u201d descended on Wisconsin and waged their usual information war to defame and destroy Judge Crawford and help Brad Schimel. The right-wing media ecosystem threw everything they had to try and help Schimel win with a nonstop torrent of lies and propaganda. They failed.\r\nLet me be clear. The real heroes who helped Judge Crawford win this critical election were all the volunteers, phone bankers, and canvassers who helped get out the vote.\r\nIn addition, Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic Chair Ben Wikler is a savant at organizing and getting out the vote. The entire Democratic Party mobilized an incredible operation.\r\nIn my opinion, Judge Crawford was also a great candidate with the perfect judicial temperament.\r\nAt the MeidasTouch Network, we made covering this race a top priority. As I am sure you\u2019ve seen, we\u2019ve relentlessly covered this race whereas corporate news was too busy focusing on whatever distraction or shiny object Trump threw at them.\r\nAt the MeidasTouch Network, we recognized early on that as the leader of all news media, with the most digital views and podcast downloads of any news network or show today, we had to meet the moment in a big way.\r\nOur focus was simple. It was imperative we push back against the lies of the right-wing media ecosystem in Wisconsin and go on the offense with the truth.\r\nWe covered this Wisconsin election not just in the days leading up to the election. As you know, we\u2019ve been covering this election for months.\r\nWe have had Judge Crawford [ https://substack.com/redirect/a80a5df9-d931-4fbb-9d76-c45532f5bd4a?j=eyJ1IjoiajdtdW0ifQ.sCMgg6RENl3vRV2I6HBtE7TLCcexj65ihVJMyWM1atU ] as a guest multiple times.\r\nWe had Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler on when he broke the news [ https://substack.com/redirect/f85b0427-9766-428c-b1c6-fa9d680f0418?j=eyJ1IjoiajdtdW0ifQ.sCMgg6RENl3vRV2I6HBtE7TLCcexj65ihVJMyWM1atU ] calling out Musk\u2019s paying-for-vote scheme.\r\nOur editorial team broke dozens of stories [ https://substack.com/redirect/f1a613e5-0578-4d27-81ac-130d7c350631?j=eyJ1IjoiajdtdW0ifQ.sCMgg6RENl3vRV2I6HBtE7TLCcexj65ihVJMyWM1atU ] about Brad Schimel\u2019s despicable behavior, positions, and statements from the past.\r\nWe at the MeidasTouch Network saw this race as a case study in how the MeidasTouch Network can use its leading position to cut through all the lies and spin and just tell the truth.\r\nWe believed the MeidasTouch Network reporting on the objective facts was the perfect antidote against the Musk and Trump propaganda machine in Wisconsin.\r\nI can\u2019t quantify how big of a role our coverage played. I again want to emphasize the real heroes here are not us, but all the volunteers and the voters in Wisconsin and all those on the ground. But it has warmed my heart to hear all the feedback we have been getting at the MeidasTouch Network that our network effectively shut down the right-wing disinformation machine in Wisconsin.\r\nEven if we played just a small role in fighting back to stop the right-wing media from overwhelming Wisconsin with lies, I am honored and humbled to have played that tiny role.\r\nThe results in Wisconsin should give us all hope about the growing strength of the pro-democracy movement. Although the Democratic candidates did not win their elections in the Special Elections in Florida\u2019s 1st and 6th Congressional Districts, the Democrats closed the gap by almost 20 points from where the vote was back in November 2024. If these results hold, there will be a blue tsunami the likes of which has never been seen in about 19 months (579 days to be specific). The 2026 midterms are closer than you think.\r\nI know there is a lot of doom and gloom news with Trump. But it\u2019s important that you remember that Trump thought he\u2019d destroy all resistance and opposition by this point. Not only has he failed, but the opposition and resistance have grown stronger. The MeidasTouch Network has grown stronger to the position of the most viewed news network in the United States and abroad.\r\nAt the MeidasTouch Network, we are honored and humbled by the role we play here and the trust you have put in us. We fight every day and do all we can to meet the moment.\r\nThe fact that we get more views and downloads than Fox and Joe Rogan means our message is getting out. (Remember to add the MeidasTouch Podcast on Apple Podcasts [ https://substack.com/redirect/8ca8aad8-5c36-4709-ab0f-395203205457?j=eyJ1IjoiajdtdW0ifQ.sCMgg6RENl3vRV2I6HBtE7TLCcexj65ihVJMyWM1atU ] and Spotify [ https://substack.com/redirect/89b5080a-3237-4655-a5c1-93078826cc71?j=eyJ1IjoiajdtdW0ifQ.sCMgg6RENl3vRV2I6HBtE7TLCcexj65ihVJMyWM1atU ] to keep this momentum going.)\r\nLet\u2019s take the momentum from Wisconsin and build.\r\nNow is the time we need your help more than ever. We must keep building the infrastructure of this media network to prepare for what is ahead. I hope you\u2019ve seen the success from the growth of the MeidasTouch Network and why it\u2019s so important we keep growing. Your help is needed.\r\nPlease subscribe to this Substack now if you can to support our independent reporting and independent media network.\r\nWe don\u2019t have the resources of Fox or Rogan or anywhere near it, but with your support we\u2019ve stayed at the top.\r\nThanks for subscribing and helping us continue to grow, and fight, and win the information battle with the truth.\r\nMeidas+ is a reader-supported publication.

But unlike traditional search, AI platforms don\u2019t reliably offer links or transparency about ranking logic, making optimization murky at best.\r\n\r\n* **Enter the AI-SEO Arms Race:** Startups like Profound are trying to reverse-engineer AI search by generating thousands of prompts and tracking which brands show up. Their clients, including Eight Sleep and Ramp, use this data to tailor web content to AI answers\u2014like dedicated landing pages or FAQs that map to common queries.\r\n\r\n* **Amazon's AI Assistant Joins the Fray:** Brands selling on Amazon are adjusting their listings for Rufus, the platform\u2019s AI shopping assistant. Instead of splashy visuals, they\u2019re packing product pages with detailed copy\u2014because Rufus \u201creads the text,\u201d even if human customers don\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Why It Matters**:\r\nAI search is still small, but it\u2019s growing fast\u2014and that could rewrite the rules of e-commerce. With platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity influencing buyer intent, brands are being pushed to optimize not just for humans, but for bots that behave like humans.\r\n\r\nUnlike Google or Amazon, these AI tools don\u2019t yet sell prime real estate in search results, meaning influence must be earned, not bought. That could erode the value of traditional digital ad spend and empower quality-first brands. But if AI search remains opaque and resistant to gaming, it may finally create the meritocratic discovery engine marketers always claimed to have wanted.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n----------\r\n### _BEST OF THE REST_\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/9ecbb45a-fd16-4ace-9477-538fa1f97121/ai.png?t=1743589751)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n\u2794 **How Do We Share the Planet With This New Superintelligence?**\r\nHistorian-philosopher Yuval Harari argues that AI\u2019s real danger isn\u2019t killer robots\u2014it\u2019s the hijacking of human culture through synthetic speech, language, and manipulation at scale.

Expected to debut by year\u2019s end, the device will reportedly cost over $1,000 and aims to bridge the gap between today\u2019s wearable tech and full-on augmented reality. \r\n\r\nUnlike the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, these new specs will display notifications and apps through a monocular lens and respond to swipes and wrist gestures. Meta is also working on a second-gen version with a binocular display slated for 2027, as it inches closer to its long-term AR ambitions.\r\n\r\n* **Display & Controls Get an Upgrade:** The Hypernova glasses will feature a single display in the right lens\u2019s lower-right quadrant \u2014 visible when glancing downward. Users can control the device using touch-sensitive temple bars or a bundled neural wristband that recognizes hand gestures like pinching or rotating.\r\n\r\n* **iPhone Alternative in the Making:** With a UI resembling the app dock on Apple devices, the glasses will include native apps for maps, photos, and messaging (WhatsApp, Messenger). They\u2019ll run a modified Android OS and pair with a phone for calls, media, and AI-powered voice commands via Meta View.\r\n\r\n* **Next-Gen Plans & Market Strategy:** Meta is already developing a second version with dual displays (Hypernova 2), alongside a more athletic, screenless Oakley-style pair (Supernova 2). Meanwhile, the original Hypernova will feature an upgraded camera, new triangular carrying case, and is expected to be positioned as a stepping stone to Meta\u2019s full AR glasses, Artemis.\r\n\r\n**Why It Matters**\r\nThis isn\u2019t just another wearable \u2014 it\u2019s Meta\u2019s clearest swing yet at creating a post-smartphone future. The Hypernova glasses sit between today\u2019s \u201cdumb\u201d smart glasses and tomorrow\u2019s true AR headsets, aiming to ease consumers into screen-on-your-face tech. \r\n\r\nWith Apple Vision Pro targeting high-end mixed reality and Meta doubling down on everyday wearables, the battle for the next computing platform is heating up \u2014 and glasses might just be the gateway. Whether consumers are ready to spend $1,400 to find out remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/6f23f859-2a04-469c-a5dd-5e74e43df7b7/VC_Corner_pyramids.png?t=1743020798)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n----------\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/668240b6-0ede-499f-8d68-d3573b9765fe/ceo.jpg?t=1743589499)\r\nCaption: Replit CEO Amjad Masad\r\n\r\n\u2794 **Replit in Talks for $3 Billion Valuation** \u2013 The AI-powered developer platform known for popularizing \"vibecoding\" is in advanced discussions to raise new funding that would push its valuation to $3 billion, up from $1.2 billion just a year ago [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-02/-vibecoding-leader-replit-in-talks-for-3-billion-valuation?srnd=phx-technology)\r\n\r\n\u2794 **Construct Capital Raises $300M Fund** \u2013 The Washington, D.C.-based VC firm launched its second fund with a focus on startups in manufacturing, defense, and supply chain infrastructure [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/construct-capital-raises-300m-fund-for-defense-and-manufacturing-tech/)\r\n\r\n\u2794 **Qualcomm Acquires VinAI\u2019s Generative AI Division** \u2013 The chip giant has acquired the AI division of Vietnamese startup VinAI to bolster its edge AI capabilities and compete in the on-device generative AI race [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/qualcomm-acquires-generative-ai-division-of-vietnamese-startup-vinai/)\r\n\r\n\u2794 **Circle Files to Go Public** \u2013 The issuer of the USDC stablecoin has formally filed to go public, aiming to become the first major crypto firm to IPO in 2025 [Link](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/circle-files-ipo-publicly?rc=ghbbgh)\r\n\r\n\u2794 **Andreessen Horowitz Eyes TikTok Stake** \u2013 A16z has reportedly joined Oracle\u2019s investor group vying for a stake in TikTok, aiming to gain influence over the platform amid regulatory pressure [Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/01/andreessen-horowitz-is-trying-to-nab-a-piece-of-tiktok-with-oracle-report-says/)\r\n\r\n\u2794 **Revaia Raises $250M Fund** \u2013 The Paris-based growth equity firm closed its second fund to back late-stage European startups with a focus on sustainability and tech [Link](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-02/european-venture-firm-revaia-raises-250-million-for-new-fund?srnd=phx-technology)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n#### _WHAT WE\u2019RE LISTENING TO_\r\n\r\nYoutube: Kevin Scott, CTO @ Microsoft: An Evaluation of Deepseek and How We Underestimate the Chinese (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN7KYzpPfiU)\r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\n----------\r\n**Growing your startup?** \r\n\r\n\r\nWant to get in front of _**50,000+**_ leading founders, VCs and tech execs?

                "content": "View this post on the web at https://admiredleadership.substack.com/p/developing-team-members-with-a-proactive\r\n\r\nEvery leader wants a team of proactive colleagues who anticipate needs, issues, and opportunities and step up to address them without being asked.\r\nBy anticipating problems, roadblocks, and opportunities and acting on them before they arise, proactive team members make life easier for leaders and for each other.\r\nProactive team members develop an eye for situations and consider how they might unfold. They constantly scan what is planned or coming up and begin preparing now for what might occur.\r\nAs part of their planning process, they think through the best-case and worst-case possibilities of situations and then decide what actions they might take to get ahead of the negatives and take advantage of the positives.\r\nIn other words, they solve problems before they happen and pursue opportunities before they materialize.\r\nBeing proactive isn\u2019t innate or personality-driven. Everyone has the capacity to think ahead and prepare for problems and opportunities before they occur. However, some team members are much more proactive than others.\r\nWhy do some team members take the initiative over situations rather than waiting for things to happen? Unbeknownst to many leaders, it is the leader\u2019s own actions that produce or discourage proactivity.\r\nPeople anticipate and take the initiative when two things exist: an expectation that they should do so, and recognition for being proactive even when the outcome of their effort is less than desired.\r\nThe best leaders emphasize the importance of anticipating and behaving proactively. They make it a point to state that taking the initiative is expected and makes everyone and everything more effective.\r\nEmpowering others to act without being asked starts with more than permission. Because many leaders and team environments punish initiative, leaders must highlight how important it is. And that they presume people will act accordingly.\r\nPracticing proactivity in a group setting is the next step. Brainstorming about upcoming events and the possible problems and opportunities they afford is a great way to set the stage for more proactive behavior.\r\nTalking through what actions can be taken now before the event or episode occurs can be a lightbulb for some and illustrate the power of anticipation and action.\r\nBut now the real discipline begins.\r\nTeam members won\u2019t take the chance to engage proactively if they think it can get them in trouble. Anytime they see initiative, good leaders underline and thank team members for anticipating issues and opportunities and acting on them without being asked.\r\nGood leaders reward the initiative, not the outcome. Sure, it\u2019s essential to highlight how much easier, better, or more effective a given project turned out because of a team member\u2019s proactive choices. But even more important is focusing on a team member\u2019s tremendous initiative despite a lousy outcome.\r\nThis tells everyone that proactive behavior is what matters most, not the result.\r\nWhen leaders expect people to take the initiative and give them the room to do so, they are often rewarded with innovative and energetic actions that help them and the team.\r\nNothing is more rewarding for a leader than a team full of colleagues who bring a proactive attitude to everything they do. They prepare more than they repair, and that is a boon to leaders.\r\n\r\nUnsubscribe https://substack.com/redirect/2/eyJlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hZG1pcmVkbGVhZGVyc2hpcC5zdWJzdGFjay5jb20vYWN0aW9uL2Rpc2FibGVfZW1haWw_dG9rZW49ZXlKMWMyVnlYMmxrSWpvek1qSTJPRGt4TUN3aWNHOXpkRjlwWkNJNk1UWXdNemczTlRRM0xDSnBZWFFpT2pFM05ETTFPVEUzTWpBc0ltVjRjQ0k2TVRjM05URXlOemN5TUN3aWFYTnpJam9pY0hWaUxUTXpOVFUzTnlJc0luTjFZaUk2SW1ScGMyRmliR1ZmWlcxaGFXd2lmUS45N0FQalBQRWZ3Y3hMTTdYSFU3U1ZLbUpTeUpKMWVOeWEtMnJmZjVUd3ZzIiwicCI6MTYwMzg3NTQ3LCJzIjozMzU1NzcsImYiOnRydWUsInUiOjMyMjY4OTEwLCJpYXQiOjE3NDM1OTE3MjAsImV4cCI6MTc0NjE4MzcyMCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTAiLCJzdWIiOiJsaW5rLXJlZGlyZWN0In0.bWjyGpwF7VkRbrWnZCrxhvsov-Rou1Vory0ZP3IXqQ4?",
